Predicting Donor Reactivation: Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on predicting donors who are likely to reactivate and contribute more than €30, enabling a targeted reactivation campaign. The goal is to optimize outreach efforts by leveraging predictive modeling and advanced analytics.

Project Overview

  Objective: Design a machine learning model to predict potential donors for reactivation campaigns.
  Dataset: Historical donor data split into training and testing datasets.
  Target Variable: Donors who contributed more than €30 in the past.

Key Steps

  Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared data for analysis, addressing missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
  
  Modeling: Evaluated six machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.
  
  Evaluation: Selected the two best models based on their AUC scores and assessed performance using:
   
    Lift Curves: Measured the effectiveness of targeting higher probability donors.
   
    Cumulative Gains: Showcased the percentage of donors captured in each decile.
 
    Classification Report: Evaluated precision, recall, and F1-score.
